# 0x00. C - Hello, World

Welcome to the "0x00. C - Hello, World" project! This project is designed to introduce you to the fundamentals of the C programming language and its essential concepts. By completing the tasks in this project, you will gain a strong foundation in C programming and explore various aspects of the language.

## Learning Objectives

Throughout this project, you will:

- Discover why C programming is considered awesome and its importance in the world of software development.

- Learn about the creators and influential figures in the history of C programming, including Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan, and Linus Torvalds.

- Understand the compilation process in C programming and what happens when you type `gcc main.c`.

- Explore the concept of an entry point and the role of the `main` function in a C program.

- Master the art of printing text using standard functions like `printf`, `puts`, and `putchar`.

- Get familiar with the unary operator `sizeof` to determine the size of specific data types.

- Learn how to compile C code using the `gcc` compiler and discover the default program name when compiling with `gcc`.

- Dive into the official C coding style and how to check your code using `betty-style`.

- Discover how to find the right header to include in your source code when using standard library functions.

- Understand how the `main` function influences the return value of a C program.
